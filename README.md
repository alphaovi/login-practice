This is my practice project where I implement my login system using firebase.
But the google login button was implement using React-firebase-hooks
React firebase hooks easy to use but the main problem is when I create the login form using react-hook-form
that's time I used the firebase login system cause that's easy in that way but the google login button was easily use using
react-firebase-hooks..
That's why I practice the same project using different technology.
